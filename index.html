It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

<h2>How Ayodhya Ram Mandir can become India's Mecca and Vatican of domestic and global tourist hub</h2>
In a monumental religious event, the grand opening of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22 has not only marked a significant spiritual occasion but is also poised to unleash a substantial economic impact, according to a report by foreign brokerage firm Jefferies. The $10 billion makeover, encompassing a new airport, revamped railway station, township, improved road connectivity, and more, is anticipated to generate a multiplier effect in and around Ayodhya. This comprehensive transformation is not only expected to attract a substantial influx of tourists, with projections reaching over 50 million annually, but it also sets a potential template for infrastructure-driven growth in the tourism sector across the country.
Jefferies' report highlights Ayodhya as a catalyst for boosting India's tourism industry, transforming the ancient city from a quiet town to a global religious and spiritual tourist hotspot, akin to Mecca and Vatican. The cornerstone of this transformation is the new Ram temple, constructed at a cost of $225 million.
In the fiscal year 2019, tourism made a $194 billion contribution to the GDP (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic). The forecast suggests an anticipated 8 percent Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), projecting the tourism contribution to reach $443 billion by the fiscal year 2033.
The current tourism-to-GDP ratio in India stands at 6.8 percent, which is lower than that of many significant emerging and developed economies, trailing behind by 3-5 percentage points.
